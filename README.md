# Node js Master class Assignment 2

Docs for the api are generated using apidocs. http://apidocjs.com.

to see what is possible with the api, generate the docs with

`npm install -g apidoc`
inside project directory 

`apidoc -i ./ -o doc`
`open doc/index.html`

NOTE: I have already generated them so you directly navigate to them.

## What is possible with the current project

* Creating user , login, and logout
* Create shopping cart, add items to it and convert it to order.
* Pay via stripe.
* Email sent on successfull order generation.
* All is done via vanilla node.js :).
